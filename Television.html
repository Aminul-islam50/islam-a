and types of refrigerators in Bangladesh.

   <h1> What is Walton Refrigerator?</h1>
   <p> A refrigerator is a machine that keeps things cold, especially food. Some people 
   also call it Fridge or Icebox. This super cooling machine is used by people to preserve
   food. This keeps the food fresh and cold and doesn’t let the food go bad. Not only does
   it preserves food, but it also helps keep drinks cold. This cold drink is a lifesaver 
   during the summer days. Who doesn’t like a cold sweat drink or beverage on a hot sunny
   day? Keeping the foods or drinks cold for a long time helps them stay good and fresh and 
   thus it can be used in the near future. A refrigerator contains hardware called the heat
   pump. The main function of this device is to take away the heat from 
   inside the refrigerator. Thus, this helps to keep the fridge cold and the temperature to remain 
   at the optimum level.</p>
   <h1> Importance of a refrigerator</h1>
   <p> The refrigerator is used to preserve food for a long time.
   This is made possible due to the low temperature inside a fridge. 
   The cold temperature allows food to not be spoiled or contaminated by bacteria for a long time.
   It slows down the process of bacteria and thus the food can stay fresh for a long time. Families
   are very much benefited from this food preserving solution. Refrigerators are also a solution to food wastage. 
   People can now store the leftover food inside the refrigerator for future intake. Foods and drinks, therefore,
   stay fresh and edible for a long time. Without refrigerators, it would have been really hard to preserve foods.
   The leftovers or fresh foods would have become contaminated by bacteria.</p>
   <p> Inverter Technology
The inverter technology of Walton has been a superhero for many family's wallet.
 This technology has saved a lot of electricity bills for families. The inverter 
 technology not only does save bills but also gives the refrigerators a high performing 
 capability as well. So you are getting the most ideal refrigerator which gives the best
 performance and also saves your electricity bill every month.

The Magical NANO SILVER TECHNOLOGY
The NANO technology is there to save you food from the harmful 
effects of diseasing causing bacteria. The cell of the disease
causing bacteria has cell membranes and nucleus. The cell membrane
of these bacteria has a negative ion property. The NANO SILVER has 
a positive ion property by nature. Whenever the cell membrane of the
 bacteria gets in touch with the NANO SILVER, the cell membrane is
 broken down thanks to the silver particle. This causes the bacteria to
 die. This is how the food is kept safe inside the fridge and stays fresh for
 a long time. There is no risk of any sort of bacterial contamination.

Usage of a Refrigerator
 followed in order to keep the refrigerator working and fully functioning.
 Walton Refrigerator produces the best refrigerators in Bangladesh. To get
 the optimum performance in a fridge, following simple guidelines will do the trick.

• Overstuffing- Although a full refrigerator works best but overstuffing the
 refrigerator will cause problems to it. Overstuffing a fridge blocks the vents 
 of it from where the cold air is to come out. This puts pressure on the condenser
 and more electricity is pulled by it in order to function at an optimum level.
 This gives rise to the electricity bill.

• Voltage Stabilizer- Places or areas that have electricity problem should use
a voltage stabilizer to help the fridge get a constant and required voltage
 A voltage that isn’t constant can harm the parts of the fridge and make it incapable of working.

• Closed Door- Always keep the door of the fridge shut. If the door remains 
open, the inside of the fridge will not get cold enough and therefore the condenser
 will be working constantly and thus being the reason for an increase in the electricity bill.

What is the Freezer?
A freezer is also a refrigerator used to preserve food at a colder temperature. A freezer is like 
a large container just like a fridge where the temperature is set very low. The low temperature helps
 to preserve food for a longer period of time. Very low temperature means that bacteria cannot contaminate
 the food as they don’t function at low temperatures. Therefore foods remain fresh and can be stored for a longer period.

A freezer normally operates at a temperature of -180 C for which, it is able to store the food for
a longer period. Whereas a refrigerator operates at a temperature of 0o C to 4o C. A freezer is used
to store items like meat, frozen foods, and other products that require very low-temperature preservation.
Refrigerators on the other hand stores foods or products like egg, bread, milk, cheese, leftover food,
and lots of other things. These foods or products don’t require very low temperatures for storing.

Deep freezers are big-sized and shaped freezers that some people use in their homes to store meat and
fish if they buy them regularly and in high quantities. Deep freezers also have the same temperature
of a freezer. Decreasing the temperature is also possible if needed by the user. The temperature can be
controlled in a freezer. Deep freezers are also used by big industries that store food in high quantities.
 Industries like restaurants who buy meat and fish in large quantities.</p>
